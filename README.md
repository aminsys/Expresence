# Expresence
## What is Expresence

This is a web application designed to facilitate co-working at the office and coordinating the attendance of colleagues that wish to meetup at the office. The word "Expresence" is a wordplay on Experis and Presence.

The idea for this web application rose from the hassle of messaging colleagues over Teams for when one will be coming to the office to work together and socialize.
